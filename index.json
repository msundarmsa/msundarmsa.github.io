However, access to health data is challenging due to privacy and legal issues. Homomorphic encryption (HE) offers a potential solution by encrypting confidential data. However, the computational complexity of encrypted operations makes it infeasible for training with gradient descent. Prior works only deal with encrypted procedures during the inference phase of the network. To this end, we design Collective Learning protocol, a secure protocol for sharing classified time-series data within entities to train parameters of the binary classifier model partially. The protocol encrypts each data’s feature activations using HE and trains the last layers using encrypted logistic regression. We evaluate our protocol on a benchmark LSTM network trained on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) dataset. We selected the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) encryption scheme because of its ability to work with real numbers using approximate arithmetic. Our protocol improved the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) score of the in-hospital mortality prediction model. The same protocol was reimplemented using secure multi-party computation (MPC) and compared.","tags":[],"title":"Privacy Preserving Collective Learning with Homomorphic Encryption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luc Rocher","Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai","Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye"],"categories":null,"content":"  Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To anonymize and share data widely, de-identification is the main tool used in academia and industry. Yet mounting evidence suggest that de-identification may not protect people’s privacy in practice. We present The Observatory of Anonymity, an interactive website demonstrating how few pieces of personal data can easily re-identify us. Taking advantage of modern web technologies, it allows participants to explore their correctness score—the likelihood to be correctly and uniquely identified from their demographics only. Trained on census data from 89 countries, it demonstrates the effectiveness of re-identification attacks on deemed-anonymous data. The website further allows analysts to upload their own data samples to train our machine learning models in real time. The Observatory provides a unique tool for individuals, researchers, and practitioners to assess whether current de-identification practices satisfy the anonymization standards of modern data protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA.","tags":[],"title":"The Observatory of Anonymity: An Interactive Tool to Understand Re-Identification Risks in 89 countries","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"3c4984fb7b44e15baa725598cf586a77","permalink":"https://msundarmsa.github.io/project/stasys/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stasys/","section":"project","summary":"Created an open source aim tracing software for air pistol/air rifle targets using OpenCV.","tags":["Personal"],"title":"STASYS","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://msundarmsa.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
