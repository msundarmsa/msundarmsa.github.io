I am a PhD Researcher at University College London under the supervision of Prof. [Emiliano De Cristofaro](https://emilianodc.com/).

### Research
My research interests lie in the general area of privacy, machine learning and applied cryptography. In the final year of my undergraduate degree at Imperial College London, I investigated the privacy guarantees of deployed local differentially private algorithms. After that, I worked at the Data Security Group, Institute for Infocomm Research where I optimized and implemented protocols for secure collaborative analytics using Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multiparty Computation. More recently, my research interests include investigating the privacy guarantees of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms.
